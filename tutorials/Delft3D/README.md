# DeltaX_Application_Workshop
Delft3D model files for the 2022 Delta-X application workshop

In the simulation_files.zip folder, the files to run the NASA Delta-X Delft3D model in Terrebonne Bay are collected. All files have been prepared using the Delt3D GUI and QUICKIN tools.
The model runs a simulation with modules FLOW/MOR coupled with SWAN. Two additional files are included: config_d_hydro.xlm and run_flow2d3d_omp.sh. These files allows to run the model on Linux machine.
In the deltaX_d3d_workshop.zip fodler, the powerpoint presenation from the workshop is stored.

VERY IMPORTANT!!
The model here reported is NOT at its final form. It will be constantly upgraded using field and remote sensing data from the Delta-X campaigns.
